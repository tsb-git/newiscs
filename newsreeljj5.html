                                    </a>
									<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                                    <p>In terms of Geo-political significance, the Indian
Ocean can play a vital role in our future endeavour.
Once a neglected region, now it is viewed as the
ocean of opportunities in the 21st century. Keeping in
consonance with the transition of the strategic sphere
of influence and the shift from continental to Ocean,
there is a paradigm shift from Atlantic Ocean to Indian
Ocean in the last decades because of its strong economic
and political raison d'Ãªtre to spotlight the Indian Ocean
as a key emerging region in world affairs and strategic
priorities of Asia-Pacific region. In recent past it has been
seen in the context of strategic dimension; the Indian
Ocean is becoming a pivotal region of cooperation and
competition. Indeed, there is an obvious sense in which
the Indian Ocean region is the future.</p>
									
									<p>In the changed circumstances, the Indian Ocean ranked
as international trade highway is more significant, while
international military presence in the Indian Ocean is
unprecedented. USA, Japan and China are investing
hundreds of billions of dollars across the region
including digital economy, energy and infrastructure
projects. Meanwhile, the emergence of Russia and Saudi
Arabia besides France and India as important players in
the region makes more volatile and to spread influence
across the entire Indian Ocean region through trade
and commerce, diplomacy and strategic partnerships.
The economies of many Indian Ocean countries are
expanding rapidly as investors seek new opportunities
in countries like India. India is the fastest growing and
robust economy and global standing as an upholder of
law and democratic values and it is also the one with the
most potential in the region to counterbalance outside
forces in the vicinity of Indian Ocean region.</p>
									<p><b>Indian Ocean: An Ocean of Opportunities:</b></p>
									<p>The Indian Ocean region consists of countries
surrounding the Indian Ocean, including India and
some African countries. In terms of global geo-politics,
the Indian Ocean region has been gaining prominent
attention amid the intensifying trade conflict between
the USA and China. Indian Ocean is the third largest
water body of the world that has vital sea lanes of
communication (SLOCs) crisscrossing it and which
feeds Asiaâs largest economies. Around 80 percent of
the worldâs seaborne oil trade passes through the choke
points of this ocean and therefore it literally connects
the east to the west. Approximately 50 percent global
container shipments sail on these waters. Furthermore,
this region has emerged as blue economy â a vital
intersection of maritime trade, connecting the countries
which are producers of natural resources with the
consumer states.</p>
									<p>Despite growing competition among major powers,
there has been a gradual build-up of regional forces in
and around the Indian Ocean region and presence of
extra-regional powers pose threat to the existing security
framework. Eventually, the top priority is to enhance
safety and security in order to ensure peace, stability
and sustainable economic growth of the region. The
geo-political framework in the Indian Ocean provides
the strategic opportunities to India in particular and
it could enhance economic and cultural interactions
which would not only add to Indiaâs prosperity, but also
enable us to play a dominant role in the region.</p>
									
									<p><b>Cooperation is key to securing maritime security in
the Indian Ocean</b></p>
									<p>Maritime security is an increasing concern for the
Indian Ocean countries; especially security threats
present real challenge to the entire global chain of
supply. Besides traditional and non-traditional safety
and security challenges including piracy, armed robbers
at sea, terrorism, human trafficking, illicit migration,
drugs trafficking, smuggling of weapons and other
unlawful activities. Littoral countries around the
Indian Ocean have attempted to address maritime
security issues through a variety of initiatives ranging
from multilateral to regional organizations redirecting
its commitments to protect the common interests.
Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has represented
geographical span and clout to become the regionâs
leading contributor to maintain maritime security in the
Indian Ocean, particularly on those issues which require
cooperation across the entire littoral states. However,
due to varied interests, the Indian Ocean countries are facing tremendous challenges in terms of external
threats.</p>
									<p>Secondly, the geo-political salience of the Indian
Ocean increases and the island nations particularly
assume a critical role. However, taking into the account
the trends in the region in 2019, India, USA, France and
Japan must remember and acknowledge the priorities
of the island nations for meaningful engagement. The
primary concern of India is non-traditional threats such
as illegal fishing, natural disasters, drug smuggling and
many more. Thus, India is looking for engaging countries
around the Indian Ocean to secure its own strategic
interests. They should be able to offer assistance that
mitigate their concerns too. India is in the process of
reinforcing its military capabilities gradually towards
effective ârebalancingâ of its naval resources, reflecting
its relatively increased threats perception from the
Indian Ocean region. There is also an urgent need to
engage with the island nations of the western Indian
Ocean. These islands can play a critical role in bridging
the Indian Ocean with continental Africa. Choke
points and strategic water ways such as Mozambique
Channel, Cape of Good Hope and South Madagascar
are key transit routes for trade between Africa, Europe,
the Middle East, and Australia which are significantly
important for adherence of international trade and
commerce.</p>
									
									<p><b>Strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands</b></p>
									<p>India is the largest country in the Indian Ocean
region and has a military base in Andaman and Nicobar
Islands in the eastern side of Bay of Bengal. The base is
a point of strategic importance that can exert a great
deal of influence over the sea lanes from the Middle East
to the Strait of Malacca. In the wake of Kargil war, the
GOI decided to establish the unified Theatre Command
viz., Andaman and Nicobar Command (2001) to cater
the strategic requirements of island territory and to
check extra-territorial powersâ presence in the Indian
Ocean region. With the inception of this command,
India is furthermore better placed to maximize the
utility of its own island territories in the midst of the
Indian Ocean. Indeed, Andaman and Nicobar Islands
offer excellent potential to enable strategic advantages
and key geographic access across all choke points in the
Indian Ocean.</p>
									<p>Similarly, India is increasingly attentive to its
interests in the Indian Ocean region. Therefore,
Indian government advanced three-pronged strategy
in the Indian Ocean region â to strengthen trade and development, good neighbourliness and friendship and
security and cooperation. In view of the above strategies,
India re-oriented its overall security strategy since
Mumbai terrorist attack, 2008. Eventually, India will try
to put forth a strong hand in this region for fundamental
national security reasons. Further India is aware that
protecting Indiaâs EEZ of over 2.3 million square
kilometres exclusively is a challenging task for securing
Indiaâs energy lifelines. Promoting overseas markets and
fulfilling international
commitments are some
of the interests to
which India is sensitive.
Indiaâs political
leadership is convinced
that matters related
to maritime doctrines
are going to play an
increasingly important
and critical role in the
near future. Therefore
India proposes safe
and secure maritime
environment to achieve
sustained national
development.</p>

									<p>Under âAct East
Policyâ, India is
engaging many littoral
states and acquiring
a more pronounced
maritime orientation
and developing closer
links with one another.
Diplomatic initiatives
to promote economic,
strategic and cultural
relations with the vast
Asia-Pacific region
at different levels
have underscored
the importance of
this region in recent
times. Prime Minister
Narendra Modi made
a speech in 2015, âThe
Indian Ocean Region is
at the top of our policy priorities.â Further he stated
that the Ocean has long been a key determining factor
of Indiaâs cultural footprint with people, religion,
goods and customs spreading from India to Africa, the
Middle East and Southeast Asia and vice-versa. Today, 95 percent of Indiaâs trade by volume and 68 percent
of trade by value comes via Indian Ocean. 80 percent
of crude oil requirement is imported by sea via the
Indian Ocean. Therefore India is heavily dependent on
the resources of the Indian Ocean in terms of fish and
aquaculture industry, which are also major source of
exports. Finally there is a strong security dimension to
Indiaâs engagement with the Indian Ocean countries,
beyond traditional naval considerations. India has also
been playing a more proactive role in humanitarian and
disaster relief operations with the help of Andaman and
Nicobar Command (ANC). In security terms piracy,
unregulated migration and presence of non-state actors
in the region pose significant threat to the Indian subcontinent.
Similarly, non-traditional security issues such
as climate change, illegal fishing, drug smuggling and
human trafficking will come to play a bigger role in the
geo-politics of the Indian Ocean. Interestingly, sea piracy
has declined considerably in the Indian Ocean due to
coordinated efforts of India and its neighbours. India
is committed to secure the shared interests in Indian
Ocean which indicates a close alignment between India
and global interests.</p>
									<p>Indiaâs interactions with Indian Ocean littoral
countries will enhance its ability and prove its pivotal
role within geo-strategic realm of the Indian Ocean. In
order to prevent extra-territorial powers and to check
non-state actors, New Delhi embarked upon bilateral
agreements for coordinated patrols with Myanmar,
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand. Although the
maritime surveillance and policing capability of A&N
has lately been improved considerably in the context
of Mumbai attacks. New Delhi is fostering relations to
build âbridges of friendshipâ known as âMILANâ â a biannual
event with the maritime neighbours to exchange
ideas and sharing defence expertise with one another
which is a âwin win situationâ for each other. Indeed,
there is a particular strategic importance to India up
to Cambodia via Myanmar and Bangladesh, where
Chinaâs influence is growing. The India-Myanmar-
Thailand Trilateral (IMT) highway will help greatly
in the transport connectivity which is almost 3660 km
long cross border highway network envisaged to enable
trade between India and the other ASEAN countries
including Vietnam. This would also serve to enhance
Indiaâs presence in the Fareast Asia. As a goodwill
gesture to reciprocate, the friendly ties between India
and Myanmar have already improved vastly. India
has always been trying to improve its relations with
its neighbouring countries especially with politically
torn states of the Indian Ocean region. Meanwhile, the
Indian government encouraged the illegal migrants to
repatriate to their respective countries since 2005. The
burgeoning migrant smuggling and human trafficking
industries can pose a genuine threat to law and order,
especially where they are related to organized crime and
intersect with the movement of illicit goods, including
weapons and drugs. In this case, it is not the migrants,
but those who take advantage of them, are criminals.</p>
									<p>Acknowledging its limited presence in the Indian
Ocean, recent speeches and statements by Indian
government foreign officials have underlined the need
to focus on and partner with like-minded countries in
the sub region. India and other stakeholdersâ navies
had also carried various military and naval exercises
in the eastern Indian Ocean Region in recent months
such as âMalabar exerciseâ. Such exercises are part of
ground maritime cooperation between countries in the
wake of Chinese growing influence and increased forays
in the Indian Ocean region. India and USA, Russia,
France and Japan appear to be realizing the strategic
partnership which expands Delhiâs presence into the
Indian Ocean and expanding maritime cooperation
among traditional powers in the Indian Ocean aimed
at maintaining a favourable strategic environment in a
changing geo-political contours. It is also a known fact
that Chinaâs growing role in the Indian Ocean region
and its proliferation of conventional arms to various
South Asian countries including Pakistan is a serious
concern for India. Paralleling this concern with China,
there is also some worry about the growing role of nonstate
actors in the region. In July 2020, the Indian Navy
carried out a military exercise with a US navy carrier
strike group led by the nuclear powered aircraft carrier
USS Nimitz off the coast of the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands to demonstrate a strong foothold in the Indian
Ocean region.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
									<p>It is expected that the Indian Ocean region will be
centre of commerce, cooperation and conflicts in a
decade and so. The recent developments in the Indian
Ocean region prompted Asia-Pacific countries except
China like Australia, Japan, United States and India to
join hands together in a collaborative partnership. These
arrangements could be the face of Indiaâs expanding role
as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region. It
is rightly said that India is centre of the Indian Ocean
and it is assigned a firm position to play a vital role in
the quest for peace and stability in the region.</p>
