Humanity at crossroads</h2>
                                    </a>
                                    <p>
The earth has existed for more than 4.5 billion
years. The evidence of the earliest life form on the
planet goes back to 3.7 billion years signifying a living
planet for the bulk of its geological history. During this
unfathomably eventful period, life has evolved from the
simple to the complex despite facing at least five events
of mass extinctions within a geological blink of an eye.
The most extreme of such events, called the Permian-
Triassic extinction, occurred about 250 million years
ago and led to a decline of 96 percent of marine species
and 70 percent of land species. Despite leaving an
indelible mark on the planet, extinction events have not
been able to wipe out life from the planet. Life, albeit
in its most simple and rudimentary form, has always
found a secure corner of the planet to seek refuge during
the period of crisis and bounce back with a remarkable
degree of biocomplexity once the inhibiting conditions
ceased.</p>
									<p>However, what has remained constant is that after
each of these existential threats to life on the planet,
the composition of species has never remained the same
again. Whenever these reset buttons have been pressed,
older species have faded and new species have emerged
to fit the changed ecological niches. The dawn of the
Anthropocene has placed humans as the nerve centre
of the planet. As a geological marker of this new epoch
– Anthropocene, the ubiquitous plastic has emerged as
a reliable indicator, registering a global presence and
forming a distinctive stratum. Our collective activities
have substantially altered the surface of the Earth, its
atmosphere, oceans and processes, often to the detriment
of other life forms with whom we share the planet.
Faced with another existential crisis, it is worthwhile to
ponder what would a sixth mass extinction event hold
for the future of humanity?</p>
									<p><b>Ecosystems in peril</b></p>
									<p>At the threshold of yet another World Environment
Day and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
(2021-2031), it is appropriate to remind ourselves
that the planet is currently undergoing its sixth mass
extinction. Only this time there are no natural causes
behind this global environmental change and resultant
loss of species diversity on the planet. Its most intelligent
inhabitant has pressed the reset button for itself and all
life forms with severe and irreversible consequences. As
it has happened in the past, life will again recuperate
after a geological hiatus but we will certainly perish as
would other complex life forms on the planet. Therefore,
notwithstanding the apparent disdain for being contrary
to popular altruistic notions of magnanimity, it must be
stated that climate action and the protection of earth’s
biological diversity is a selfish human endeavour. Our
best efforts to hold ourselves separate from nature and
adopt an anthropocentric perspective to make sense of
the complexities of the natural world has not fructified.</p>
									<p>We remain dependent on the natural world in various
ways. Healthy ecosystems can be understood as factories
of the natural world providing us with various goods
and services that make it possible for us to exist in the
form and manner that we do. These can range from the
material benefits that we obtain from the ecosystem
(provisioning services like food, freshwater, fibre etc.)
to the various forms of regulatory attributes that enable
habitable conditions for us (regulating services like
flood and erosion control, climate regulation, water
purification etc.). We may also draw our cultural
identity or spiritual well-being from nature signifying the
cultural services of ecosystems. Additionally, underlying
all of these, are the supporting services that constitute
the ecosystem processes and functions that enable
the delivery of the other services (nutrient recycling,
soil formation etc.). This interdependence on natural
ecosystems is immense and intricate and consistent
with the way other life forms also depend on each other
and their natural environment through a network of
interdependent systems – an ancient balancing act.</p>
									<p>With the global degradation of natural ecosystems,
we stand vulnerable to the changing conditions on the
planet and disruption of the ecosystem services that we
have been deriving from nature. To visualise the same
from an anthropocentric perspective, the concept of
planetary boundaries is a useful tool. It suggests that
there are nine planetary boundaries within which
humanity can continue to thrive but crossing these
boundaries would increase the risk of abrupt, largelargescale
and irreversible environmental changes (Ref to
Fig.1). As per estimates in 2015, four such boundaries
have already been crossed including climate change
and biosphere integrity (with partial confirmation)
while the status of three boundaries including that of
novel entities such as plastics remains unconfirmed.2
It must be borne in mind that climate and biosphere
integrity provide overarching systems within which the
other boundary processes operate. Large-scale changes
in either of them or both could push the Earth system
out of the Holocene state in a rather quick manner for
most life forms to adapt – particularly complex ones
like humans. Needless to say, we are living in perilous
times. Despite our knowledge of how seemingly affluent
societies, such as the Mayan or Egyptian, have perished
due to the disharmony with their immediate natural
surroundings, do we have the appetite to learn from the
past to secure our future?</p>

									<p>The India story
The world looks at India for a potential template that
could be followed by all other economies in transition.
As a champion of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, India represents the same issue that is
currently faced by numerous countries in the global
south. Representing one-fifth of humanity, the country
has a population that is young, dynamic and aspirational.</p>
									<p>Despite a certain demographic dividend, it faces
multitudinous challenges of keeping this population
healthy, providing quality education, managing rapid
urbanisation and undertaking its share of climate action
as a part of the global community. The all-important
challenge that currently underpins many of the other
ones is to lift this burgeoning population out of poverty
through hard infrastructure while balancing the needs
of the ecosystems.</p>
									<p>So far, it does appear that India has been doing
exceptionally well on the front of climate action. It has
achieved two of the three targets that it had pledged to
in the Paris agreement which seeks to limit the average
global temperature rise to well below 2°C above
preindustrial levels and preferably within 1.5°C. India
has already reduced its emission intensity per unit of
GDP by 21 percent and is well within the course to
meet its target of 33 to 35 percent reduction from the
2005 emission intensity of GDP by 2031. Moreover,
the share of non-fossil fuel sources in the cumulative
power generation capacity is already 38% – just 2
percent short of its conditional target for 2030. Even
on the third commitment to creating a cumulative
carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent, India seems to be making progress, albeit
at a woefully slow rate, by registering an increase in
the forest cover by 2.9 percent between 2011 and 2019.
Despite these encouraging pieces of evidence testifying
climate action, it must be pointed out that it may not
lead to the restoration of ecosystems for harmonising
the relationship that we share with nature.</p>
									<p>Ecosystems are more than just geographical units; they
are a functional system unit comprising of autotrophs
and heterotrophs that are linked by appropriate energy
flows, nutrient cycles and storages. Such arrangements
are arrived at over a considerably long period. Merely,
planting trees through compensatory afforestation or
creating waterbodies would not be able to replicate
an ecosystem that used to exist in all its functional
glory. This becomes particularly concerning when one
considers the fact that the government has pushed for
the creation of infrastructure in the ecologically fragile
parts of the country leading to habitat fragmentation
and destruction. From the high mountains in the
Himalayas to the coastal zones dotted with mangroves
belts or even the mineral-rich hinterland in the country,
resource extraction and pollution has continued at the
cost of collapsing ecosystems.</p>
									<p>The most important and perhaps the only bulwark
against such acts – the Environment Impact Assessment
(EIA) rules in India too stand diluted as the current
administration has initiated a good faith doctrine that
permits industries to self-report their environmental
impacts. In its most recent avatar, the 2020 draft EIA has
further sought to enable post facto clearance of projects
and the dilution of public consultation. Evidence from
the State of Environment Report, 2021 by the Centre for
Science and Environment (CSE) have pointed out that
between 2009 and 2018, India’s air, water and land have
become more polluted. The Central Pollution Control
Board has noted that out of 88 major industrial clusters
in the country, 35 have recorded overall environmental
degradation while 33, 45 and 17 industrial complexes
have contributed in a major way to the pollution of air,
water and land respectively. All this despite a regulatory
framework that is in place to control and curb pollution
in the country.
Alternate thinking</p>
									<p>It is evident from the discussions above that
environmental governance in the country requires
an overhaul. The global community is set to issue a
clarion call to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation
of ecosystems in every continent and ocean with the
beginning of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
on World Environment Day, 2021. The current
paradigm anchored on an anthropocentric worldview
has proven to be inadequate to address the entire range
of threats that affect ecosystems globally. Mere optics of
tree planting or allowing a certain quantum of water to
remain in river channels as environmental flows along
or even wastewater treatment are woefully inadequate.
Almost as a counter to the dominant paradigm of an
anthropocentric approach to environmental governance,
an ecocentric approach has been steadily rising that
prioritises nature’s right to flourish and may hold a
certain degree of promise.</p>
									<p>Commonly known as Rights of Nature (RoN), it
is a recognition that ecosystems have the same rights
as humans to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate
their vital cycles. Moreover, it also asserts that the
responsibility to enforce these rights on behalf of
nature lies with us. To uphold such rights, either a legal
guardian needs to be appointed for looking into the
interest of the ecosystem or issues can be brought to
the attention of the judiciary by concerned citizens. The
RoN framework is a clear deviation from conventional environmental protection in the sense that communities
can work outside the regulatory system to establish
legal rights thereby disproving the long-held notion –
“communities can’t prohibit what state law permits”.
India too had its share of participation in this global
environmental movement and emerging jurisprudence
when the Uttarakhand High Court passed a judgement
in 2017 recognising the Ganga and the Yamuna as ‘living
entities’. This was subsequently stayed by the Supreme
Court but the move has already set the ball rolling and
debates have ensued on various facets of RoN and its
applicability in the Indian context.</p>
									<p>Another interesting development has been the
emergence and coming to the prominence of Green
parties worldwide. These political organisations may
follow a coherent ideology that not just includes
environmentalism as its cornerstone but also social
justice, consensus-based decision, nonviolence,
sustainability and respect for diversity – all enshrined
in the Global Greens Charter that was signed by Green
parties of 72 countries in 2001. Green parties counteract
the usual dismissive and accommodative strategies of
mainstream parties on issues that involve environmental
security. Presently, the ideology of Green parties holds
a disproportionately high affinity amongst young and
educated voters and attract greater support in countries
that have high levels of economic development and low
levels of unemployment. However, it cannot be ruled
out that their acceptance amongst the larger populace
would continue to grow as the ramifications of global
warming and a changing climate become all-pervasive
in the public discourse.</p>
									<p>Could these developments salvage humanity from the
path of self-destruction? Surprisingly, we will not have
to wait long to know the answer as we stand at a certain
