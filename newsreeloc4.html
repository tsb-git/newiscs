Historical Continuities and Contemporary
Challenges</h2>
                                    </a>
									<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs
(MEA), the population of Overseas Indians stands at
more than 32 million. To put this in context, the figure
of Overseas Indians is more than the combined total
population of Australia and New Zealand. The large
size of persons of Indian origin (PIOs) is a consequence
of colonialism and of new political realities over old
cultural geographies. Under British India, Indians were
transported in large numbers to other colonies in close
proximity as well as across vast continents. More often
than not, PIOs were minorities in the recipient colonies
and were vulnerable to narrow nationalist assertions. In
many instances, the Indian diaspora were deployed by
the colonial rulers in extractive industries and revenue
generating sectors. Tragically, the fact that PIOs were
a victim of colonialism and have also contributed to
economic growth of host societies, even under difficult
circumstances, tends to be unrecognized.</p>
                                    <p>The advent of globalisation rejuvenated diaspora
links with their home country. While the growth of
social media has facilitated better communication and
information flows, it has also played a significant role
in ‘othering’ of these communities. The Indian diaspora
across the globe has often had to navigate historical
memories and associated complex political processes.
In some cases, they tend to continue to face challenges.
This paper highlights the historical continuities and contemporary challenges of PIOs from two distinct
former British colonies – Myanmar and South Africa. The
Indian diaspora have had similar historical experiences
in these countries which have shaped current dynamics.</p>
									<p>Myanmar</p>
									<p>People to people interactions between India and
Myanmar (Burma) has a long history. In ancient times,
Burma was reportedly referred to as Brahmadesh
in Indian literature. The Tamil Chola empire had
extensive trade and economic relations with Burma and
the history of Tamil ancestry in the country goes back to
the first century AD.</p>
									<p>In the 19th and 20th century, movement of people
between India and Burma took place broadly for military,
political and business purposes. There was a significant
upswing in migration patterns from India to Myanmar
during the British colonial rule. During the three Anglo-
Burmese wars, large number of Indian foot soldiers were
used by the British. Subsequently, many of the British
regiments that manned the Burmese territories had PIOs.
While in India, the British trained and employed Indians
in the lower echelons of governance, even in Myanmar,
Indians were used for their colonial apparatus. As a
consequence, PIOs dominated formal employment
opportunities in the colonial administrative apparatus.
To facilitate expansion of agriculture, migration from
India was encouraged. Further, for ease of migration, a
“recruiting agent was appointed in India and subsidies
were given to shipping companies to transport Indian</p>
<img class="br-30 mb-30" src="img/bg-img/oc9.jpg" alt="">

									<p>immigrants to Burma.” There was also a fairly large
presence of Indian officials working on the revenue side
of the rural areas and Indian labourers working in the
docks, transport and rice mills. Burma was a province
under British India, and was primarily governed from
Calcutta. As a consequence, there was free movement
of educated people from Calcutta to Rangoon and vice
versa. Up until 1941, Rangoon comprised of over 50
per cent Indians, with Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Urdu as their lingua franca.</p>
									<p>Moreover, Indian businesspersons moved to Burma to
work with the British. Given the established interactions
between Indians and the British by that time, Indians
were more conversant with the functioning of the
colonial state. They were therefore able to engage with
rules and regulations that define business activity with
relatively greater ease. Indian businesses flourished,
although the ultimate beneficiaries were the British
colonisers. The Chettiar community had a particularly
robust presence in Burma and made their fortunes as
“financers of agriculture and trade”. Moreover, people
from Bengal moved to work in paddy fields in the
Rakhine sector which has laid emerged in the form of
sustained sectarian violence.</p>
									<p>Sadly, the dominant Indian presence in the British
army and the administrative frameworks of Burma along
with the robust presence of Indians in the economic
activities sowed the discord between the Indian and
Burmese communities. The Burmese viewed the Indian
presence as competition over scarce economic resources
and as a consequence, there were anti-Indian riots in
1930 which resulted in the deaths of over 120 people
and further deepened the discord between the Indian
community and the Burmese population. Another
round of anti-India rioting also broke out in 1938.</p>
									<p>The Second World War resulted in significant decline
of Indian population in Burma. The fact that many
Indians manned the British colonial apparatus made
them vulnerable to probable detention by the invading
Japanese forces. To avoid getting captured by these
forces and given the uncertainties associated with the
war, it is estimated that over 400,000 people from lower
Burma and other regions walked to Northeast India.
This exodus is often termed as the Long March by people
of Indian origin from Burma. At other times, migration
took place from Northeast India to Northern Myanmar
as well, and it continues even today. Each Indian
northeast state which shares a border with Myanmar
has their own equation with the adjacent Burmese
provinces. Therefore, the Indian diaspora presence in
Myanmar imuch larger than official statistics as such
movement is difficult to tabulate.</p>
									<p>After Burma’s independence. General Ne Win’s
nationalisation policies resulted in government takeover
of large number of enterprises including importexport
trade. The Indian community was most hit by
these measures and anti-Indian rhetoric prompted
approximately 2,500 Indians to leave “each week”. By
September 1964, an estimated “100,000 people were believed to have departed to India, many leaving behind
their jewellery and other valued possessions.”</p>
									<p>The challenge for Indian diasporas after the 1960s
was that because of stigmatisation and nationalisation
policies, many Burmese Indians found it difficult to
participate in productive economic activities. In order
to overcome the stigmatization, many Indians have
adopted Burmese names and often list themselves as
members of the Barman ethnic community. Nonetheless,
the political representation is not pronounced.</p>
									<p>There have been instances when PIO communities
were victims of violence. For instance, at a pilot
citizenship verification programme which was
launched in 2014, the “Rohingyas were forced to
list their ethnicity as Bengali”. There were concerns
that such categorisation will make PIOs vulnerable
during sectarian violence. An Amnesty International
investigation had found that Rohingya militant group
ARSA killed 99 Hindu civilians in a cluster of villages
in the northern Maungdaw Township during attacks in
2017. Further, in 2019, several Indian nationals were
detained by the Arakan Army in the Rakhine region.
The February 1 coup in Myanmar has rekindled old
fears for the Indian community as they may become
easy targets for the Tatmadaw.</p>
									<p>However, the Indian business community in
Myanmar continues to be robust. Despite the earlier
out-migrations, there is a fairly large Indian populace
living in Burma. Therefore, the Indian foreign policy
response towards political developments in Burma has
always had to factor in the presence and welfare of PIOs.</p>
									<p>South Africa</p>
									<p>The Indian diaspora in South Africa have a similar
history to the Burmese. The population of the Indian
diaspora in South Africa picked up due to the British
policy of using Indians as indentured labourers and
migrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. During
apartheid, they were referred to as Asians or Indians,
but the politically conscious PIOs began to identify
themselves as “Indian South Africans”. There were also
‘passenger Indians’ “who came at their own expense
to trade and work in commerce”. Currently, there are
close to 1.5 million Indians in South Africa and are
mostly settled in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province
whose largest city is Durban.</p>
									<p>Indians in South Africa faced discrimination in various
forms since the mid-19th century. A significant incident
was the Durban riots of 1949 where Indians were targeted by the Africans as “a spontaneous outburst of
long-standing grievances”. In the recent past, the Indian
community has tended to be stereotyped because of the
activities of a few business PIOs. Particularly infamous
is the Gupta family who have amassed wealth in the
country and reportedly have close links with former
President Jacob Zuma. The family has been accused of
corruption, inciting violence and causing racial tensions. </p>
									<p>In July 2021, South Africa’s KZN and Gauteng
provinces witnessed massive civil unrest which was
sparked by the arrest of former South African President
Jacob Zuma for contempt of court. Riots broke out in
various towns and there was arson and looting across
the two districts. Zuma’s supporters blocked roads and
highways resulting in an estimated loss of over USD
1.5 billion (R20 billion). The scale of destruction was
so high that it became the worst violence South Africa
has experienced since the end of Apartheid. A key
aspect of the civil unrest was the targeting of the Indian
community, especially in the town of Phoenix (north
of Durban) in the KZN province. While some reports</p>
<img class="br-30 mb-30" src="img/bg-img/oc10.jpg" alt="">

									<p>categorised the incidents as motivated by race, others
have termed it as anger among the African community
towards the Indians due to the Gupta family’s allegiance
with President Zuma. On July 14, India’s EAM Dr.
S. Jaishankar spoke to the South African Foreign
Minister Naledi Pandor and sought assurances that the
Government “was doing utmost to enforce law and
order”.</p>
									<p>Conclusion</p>
									<p>For countries such as India, large presence of PIOs
constitute an opportunity as well as a challenge. As
long as there is political stability in the host countries,
the PIOs tend to prosper. PIOs may also serve as an
important platform for India to scale up economic
engagement with countries. However, as in the case
of Myanmar and South Africa, the political situations
have often negatively impacted the lives of the PIOs.
As a result, the Indian government has sought to play
a delicate role of protecting the rights of PIOs without
interfering in the internal affairs of the states.</p>
									<p>In the long run, the Indian government should scale up and use its cultural centres to depict the numerous
challenges that PIOs have endured during the colonial
rule. Such articulation of shared histories between
the PIOs and others in various countries will create
better understanding and improved inter-societal
communication. There is also a need to scale up Indian
ODA to countries which have a large number of PIOs.	</p>
									<p>India’s ITEC and other fellowships are much respected
in various countries. These platforms can be used to
educate the fellowship recipients about the opportunities
of engaging the PIOs. To facilitate such interactions,
strength of the Indian missions in these countries should
be increased to ensure improved coordination between
Indian diplomatic staff and the local PIOs and related
stakeholders. In addition, it is important to conduct
focus group discussions in various countries to discuss
the steps that Indian government should take to protect
and promote the interests of the PIOs.</p>
