                                        <h2 class="post-headline">Story to be sung: Central Vista Project
A Nation Building its own Heritage with
indigenous thought</h2>
                                    </a>
									<p>An independent country and sovereign power does
take some decision which glorifies their existence and
stands. And it is natural because they take decisions
which are more appropriate to translate their idea
of governance and appearance, and, here no one can
interfere in it. But if it is a democratic setup then the
government is bound to take all the decisions ‘in public
interest’.</p>
                                    <p>
In Indian context and particularly with reference to
Delhi which was ruled by many dynasties and rulers
as well as governments right from its inception has
experienced many changes in its figure & shape. Delhi
has witnessed many architectural changes in different
time epoch. If in Mahabharata period (c.1500 BCE)
Pandava made their capital Indraprastha then in the last
the British made Lutyen’s Delhi their capital.

During the reign of Rajput rulers & dynasty be it of
Tomar or Chauhan they established their own capital
and carried out specific architectural activities and these
are substantiated by the archaeological remains and
studies.</p>
									<p>Similarly during Sultanate period be it Ghulam,
Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid, Lodhi they constructed their
own fort or capital in the same geographical region.
In Mughal period Shahjahan shifted his capital to
Delhi after developing a new township known as
Shahjahanabad and finally the British made Lutyen’s
Delhi the present seat of power. That’s why Delhi is
known as Indraprastha, Dilli/Dhilli or Yognipura, Lal
Kot, Qila Rai Pithora, Siri, Dinpanah, Tughlakabad,
Firozabad, Shergarh, Shahjahanabad and New Delhi
respectively during different time zones or periods. What is important to understand here is that Delhi
has been subject to change as per need or show off
the ruling clan or power? Controversies and projects
have been travelling together in India before and after
independence whether it was pro public or display the
might of the power convenient to the government. But
it is an historical fact that projects were completed
amid opposition of political parties or a section of the
public by using the might of power. These projects are
supposed to be a mirror of their foresightedness towards
futuristic plan as per demand and need of time. And the
controversy surrounded around Central Vista Project is
no exception though the ruling party claims that it is in
public interest.</p>
									<p>Hon’ble HC Delhi passed a judgement:
“The whole Central Vista is an essential
project of national importance where the
sovereign functions of the Parliament will be
conducted. The public is widely interested in
this project.”</p>
									<p>Question arises as to why there was need to conceive
a project known as Central Vista Project when Lutyen’s
Delhi has many architectural remains in the use & service
of public and government ? The people of India have
all right to know it because this project will have to be
completed with the financial support of exchequer. Some
section of society and political system were agitated due
to their love and belongingness with their heritage, some
rumour, and false information etc. about the project.
Many things and doubts are cleared by a specific Order
of Hon’ble High court and a Press Conference by the
hon’ble Minister of Government of India. One important
concern was about the demolition of existing building
of the National Museum and National Archives of India
which were constructed after long deliberation before
and after independence as an important ingredient of
Lutyen’s architectural plan. This too was addressed in
an official Press Conference by the representatives of the
ruling party. But the wish and will of all the heritage
lovers around the globe is that land mark place must
not be uprooted, disturbed or demolished just to show
the muscles of might of power or satisfy the ego. Thus
present building of National Museum and National
Archives of India shall be accommodated and adjusted
in the project maintaining in situ.</p>
									<p>Some political parties and a section of the public have
been raising a hue and cry about this project but it should
be answered by peeping into it with the support of the
archival records. While searching the archival records it
is believed to be found that Shri Jairam Ramesh had in
2012 advocated the construction of a new Parliament
building. Way back in 2012, Jairam Ramesh had said,
“We badly need a new Parliament building. This one
simply isn’t functional and is outdated.” The then Speaker’s (Meira Kumar) office had communicated to
the Secretary-Urban Development on 13 July 2012,
highlighting the inadequacies of the existing Parliament
building and an urgent need for the construction of a
new one. Chintamani Panigrahi, who served as Minister
of State in Ministries of Home Affairs and Defence
from 1986 to 1989, when another political party was
in power, had, in fact, appealed fervently for a new
Parliament building way back in 1986.</p>
<img class="br-30 mb-30" src="img/bg-img/oc3.jpg" alt="">

									<p>In 2019, the central government announced the
redevelopment project to give a new identity to the
‘power corridor’ of India. The plan envisages the
construction of a new parliament, prime minister and
vice-president’s residences along with 10 building
blocks that will accommodate all government ministries
and departments. According to the redevelopment plan,
North and South Blocks will be converted into museums.
The current Parliament building, which was built by
the British, is nearly 93 years old and poses structural
safety concerns, according to the Union Ministry of
Housing and Urban Affairs. It is “highly stressed” and
the quality of amenities it offers has “considerably”
deteriorated over the years.</p>
									
									<p>The most significant aspect of the project is the
construction of a new parliament building. There are
several reasons for needing a new building to house
the two houses of the parliament. The most important
one is the impending expansion of the size of the
parliament. Due to increased population, which have
almost quadrupled since independence, there is a need
to increase the number of Lok Sabha constituencies
through delimitation.
Similarly, the central hall of the parliament, used
to hold joint sessions, actually does not have enough
seats for the MPs of both houses. The Central hall
has around 430 seats, less than the size of Lok Sabha.
During joint sessions, temporary chairs are placed on
the aisles so that all the members can sit. Certainly it
is not a dignified scene for the parliament of the largest
democracy of the world.</p>
									<p>The infrastructure of the parliament also antiqued, as
they were added at various times as and when required.
It has microphones that can’t be switched off, a very old
electronic voting system etc. Although the parliament
building looks magnificent from the outside, the same
is not true about its inside. Due to drilling holes in the
walls to run electrical and telecommunication lines,
water and sewage pipes, air-conditioning ducts etc, it
all looks a mess from inside. Such drillings have also weakened the structure a lot.
Along with that, the area around Delhi has become
more earthquake-prone in recent times. But as the
original drawings of the building are not available now,
it not possible to certify the building as earthquakeproof
now. It is notable here that two floors have been
added on the top of the parliament building to make
space for offices, and it has almost blocked the visibility
of the central dome.
For example, the new Lok Sabha hall will be 1315
square metre in size, compared to 470 square metre in
the current one. It will also have a much larger lobby,
which is almost non-existent at present.</p>
<img class="br-30 mb-30" src="img/bg-img/oc4.jpg" alt="">
									
									
									<p>The Central Vista revamp, announced in September,
2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building,
with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to
be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will
be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common
Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under
the project.</p>
									<p>The apex court's verdict came on several pleas
on the issue, including the one filed by activists. On
December 7, last year the top court had allowed the
Centre to proceed with the foundation stone-laying
ceremony for the Central Vista project on December 10
after the government assured it that no construction or
demolition work would commence till the apex court
decides the pending pleas on the issue.</p>
									<p>Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the
foundation stone on December 10, 2020 for the new
Parliament building and the construction is expected to
be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971
crore.
The new Parliament Building Complex, which will
be triangular in shape, will spread over 64,500 square
metre. The new Parliament building is described as the pivot
of the Central Vista project design.</p>
									<p>It is to be much bigger than the existing Parliament
building and will be able to house 1,224 Members of
Parliament. The Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating
capacity of 888 MPs while the Rajya Sabha chamber
will accommodate 384 MPs. The increased capacity of
the chambers has been provisioned by keeping in mind
future increases in the number of MPs. Currently, the
Lok Sabha has 545 MPs and the Rajya Sabha 245. All
MPs will have separate offices in the new building. The
new Parliament building will have a grand Constitution
Hall showcasing India's democratic heritage. The
Constitution Hall will showcase the original copy of the
Constitution. There will be a visitors’ gallery digitally
displaying India's democratic heritage. The existing
Parliament House building will continue to be in use
by retrofitting it to provide more functional spaces for
parliamentary events.</p>
									<p>The new Parliament building will be equipped with
the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating
'paperless offices'. A monitoring committee having
members from the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the Ministry
of Housing and Urban Affairs, the CPWD, the NDMC
and architect/designer of the project will monitor the
construction work. The new Parliament building
complex is expected to be complete by 2022. The
Central Vista project has a work completion deadline of
2024, when the next Lok Sabha election will take place.</p>
									<p>It is therefore important to evaluate the Central Vista
project as a fiscal intervention. The Indian Parliament
and administrative buildings do need a major face-lift.
Most governments across the world have focused on dealing with the economic fallout, including ramping
up public spending after controlling the public health
emergency. This is true for emerging markets and
advanced economies – with advanced economies
spending far more significantly as compared to emerging
markets. As an example of a resultant demand shock,
many of us have already experienced nominal wage
cuts, job cuts, or a combination of both. Thus, with
reduced purchasing power, our ability to spend is also
bound to get affected.</p>
									<p>Therefore, the question is on how to restore the
ability of the private sector, particularly the households,
to spend as they did before the pandemic. The objective
is to revive economic growth in a sustainable manner
so that we can overcome the economic shock. It is also
important for us to recognise that a substantial part
of the population has gone back into poverty, thereby
undoing the progress we made over the last several
years. This has been an outcome of lockdowns that had
halted construction activity in urban areas, which caused
severe reverse migration. This is also visible when one
looks at the MGNREGA data, as many were depending
on it to obtain some form of income. Given that the
private sector is constrained by its ability to spend, the
only way to restore economic growth in an accelerated
manner is by the government extensively spending over
the next few years so that India’s aggregate demand is
restored. So the correct way to view the Central Vista
project is as an increase in government spending – but
this is necessary expenditure.</p>
