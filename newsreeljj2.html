                                        <h2 class="post-headline">Second wave of COVID-19 in India: Analysing
post-pandemic economic recovery</h2>
                                    </a>
									<p><b>The ferocious second wave</b></p>
                                    <p>
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in
2020, experts contemplated if the pandemic would
have several waves like the Spanish flu, which killed
approximately 50 million people from 1918 to 1920.
India, Brazil and some countries in Europe, that saw a
high number of infections early on and proceeded on
to a decline – are currently facing an alarming second
wave of increased cases and mortality rates.</p>
									<p>In India, the second wave of the pandemic that began
to tick up in March 2021 (surpassing 375,000 in a single
day; the highest daily figure in any country), six months
after the first peak in September 2020, is deadlier than
the first wave. It continues to stretch the countries’
health systems beyond its limits exposing the grave
weaknesses in the healthcare infrastructure including
shortages of clinical oxygen, nursing facilities and other
equipments. Rollout of the vaccine in the country has
also been sluggish due to scant supply. The central and
state governments have also been noticeably complacent
with its restriction measures and policy decisions.
Laxity in people’s behaviour that was observed during
festivals (Holi during end March 2021, Ramadan in
April-May 2021), election rallies (March-April 2021),
and religious congregations (Kumbh Mela in March-
April 2021), has made the situation worse. Further, the
current crisis threatens to alter the recovery trajectory
of the economy by further disrupting supply chains and
hampering existing manufacturing capacities.</p>
									<p><b>Survivability: Lives versus livelihood</b></p>
									<p>During the first wave of the pandemic, migrant
workers were the worst affected owing to stricter
lockdown measures. Shutdown of workplaces and
business activities had left many informal migrant workers jobless as they had no choice but to trudge
back to their native places. The reverse migration has
led to an adverse impact on their earnings and savings,
subsequently increasing unemployment and reducing
labour force participation. These hardships, both
financial and physical have further aggravated with the
resurgence of the pandemic’s second wave.</p>
									<p>Economies with surging cases due to the second wave
have again become insulated after borders are partially
closed down and trade disrupted. Many business
operations have been seriously affected because of
low producer confidence and other restrictions like
low working hours and limited workforce. Business
competitiveness and new business opportunities like
expansion, revenue maximisation, and job creation
through partnerships, have also plummeted.</p>
									<p>With the unemployment rates in India hovering at
5.45 percent in November 2020 from a peak of 27.11
percent in May 2020, the full scale of the crisis is difficult
to document, as around 90 percent of people work in
the unorganized sector in “precarious” jobs or are selfemployed.
Although the Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS),
which subsidized food grains and cash transfers to
farmers and women, has provided some degree of social
security, the poor and marginalized communities still
face the threat of disguised unemployment.
It has been more than a year since the beginning of
the COVID-19 pandemic, which should highlight the
need to avoid the negative consequences of long-term
unemployment. According to CMIE, unemployment
rate increased from 6.7 percent at the end of March to
8.6 percent in April 2021. Given the grim conditions of
the economy, the sustained 8.5 percent growth required
to employ 10-12 million youth in the formal sector is yet
to be achieved. There is a sustained need for inclusive
large-scale policy measures that support job-creating
enterprises and overall business environments.</p>
									
									<p><b>SDGs: Interconnectedness and long-term impacts</b></p>
									<p>There is a strong interconnectedness between the
trinity of – sustainability, businesses and the COVID-19
pandemic. While the pandemic has slowed business,
further crushed consumption demand and disrupted
many product value chains, it has also pushed businesses
and the governments towards the idea of incorporating
the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
framework in their day-to-day business. Further, the
Sustainable Development Report 2020 shows that the
countries that have been progressing with the SDGs
have had a better response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hence even though, unemployment and survivability is
at stake in the light of the current crisis, lack of focus in
achieving the SDGs would impede economic recovery in
the longer horizon.</p>
<img class="br-30 mb-30" src="img/bg-img/j4.jpg" alt="">
									
									
									<p>There is no doubt that the pandemic has hindered
the progress of the SDGs. Just when the economy was
on the path of recovery with vaccines being rolled out
in different parts of the world, India was hit by a more
severe and ghastly second wave. On one hand, SDG 3
(good health and well-being), that plays a crucial role
than any other development objective at the moment,
is achieved through the development of vaccines and
immediate measures to enhance medical infrastructure
across the globe. On the other, economic growth has
been slow and unemployment has been rising with an
asymmetric effect on the labour market as more women
than men are being laid off (SDG 8), innovation and
infrastructure capacity building has been slacking (SDG
9), poverty (SDG 1) and inequality gap has increased
(SDG 10), clean water and sanitation targets are not
met (SDG 6) and food security has also become an issue
(SDG 2) among others.
The negative impact of the second wave on SDGs is
bound to have spill over effects on the Ease of Doing
Business (EoDB) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
inflow too. This is primarily because goals 8 (decent
work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation
and infrastructure) and 16 (peace, justice and strong
institutions) have indicators that capture certain
elements of EoDB that are crucial in attracting foreign
investments. The following figure depicts a steady
increase in India’s SDG and EoDB Indices in the last
five years, establishing indicative evidence of positive
relationship between the two.
In order to lead the recovery in the post-pandemic
economy and create a fair, equitable and sustainable
world, SDGs will be pivotal in making the transition.
The SDGs are linked with the main types of capital
that are important for the long term economic health
of a country viz. human capital which is addressed
through goals dealing with education, health, hunger,
poverty, gender and sanitation; social capital is
addressed through the goals that deal with equality,
international cooperation, sustainable cities, peace and
justice; natural capital is addressed through the goals
dealing with various aspects of biodiversity, climate
and responsible consumption and production; physical
capital on the other hand is addressed through goals
that deal with economic growth, clean energy, industry
and infrastructure.
In fact, a study by Observer Research Foundation
suggests strong econometric evidence where the Indian
state-wise SDG scores are also statistically significant
in explaining the states’ EoDB and FDI inflows. The
inter-dependence between the SDGs and business has
immense implications in terms of local action and
national policy to cope with the economic ruins from the
pandemic. SDGs would not only promote new business
opportunities, but more importantly, they would also
help in sustaining conducive investment climate in the
country.</p>
									<p><b>The way forward</b></p>
									<p>For the loss of livelihood they incurred due to
the pandemic, migrant workers and the overall
unemployment issue needs to be prioritised by providing
adequate social safety nets and health insurance. The
magnitude of work under MGNREGA should be
increased to absorb a wide range of skilled and unskilled
labourers. As proposed by economist Jean Dreze, a
demand-driven urban employment programme could
also help in urban infrastructure rejuvenation while
creating jobs for millions of urban poor when they need
it the most.</p>
									<p>Finally, an integrated holistic approach should be
devised as a response to the pandemic with respect to
SDGs. Policy makers must not lose sight of challenges to
the implementation of SDGs that predated the current
crisis. SDGs shouldn’t be merely seen as a measure
confined to looking at development, but also an
important instrument to reflect on business environment
in India. Global players and governments must come
together with renewed political will and engagement.
An acknowledgement of the situation must be followed
by deliberation over possible solutions to remedy
societal evils and address challenges at the very core of
our economies.</p>
