                                        <h2 class="post-headline">IS PRIVACY A MYTH ?</h2>
                                    </a>
									<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
                                    <p>Privacy is defined as an option to have secrecy,
the state of being free from public attention. Richard
Hughes defined privacy as the right of people to conceal
information about themselves that others might use
to their disadvantage. Privacy has historical roots
in ancient Greek philosophical discussions of which
Aristotle’s distinction of ‘polis’ (public sphere political
life) and ‘oikos’ (private sphere of domestic life) was the
most well-known.</p>
									<p>The different domains of privacy includes Physical,
Behavioral, Psychological, Normative, Digital privacy,
etc.</p>
									<p>The domain of privacy partially overlaps with
security, including the concepts of appropriate use and
protection of information. This brings us to our main
question “Is Privacy a Myth?”</p>
									<p><b>DIGITAL AGE AND PRIVACY</b></p>
									<p>We are respiring in a Digital Milieu overshadowed
by AI technology, where everything ranging from
rudimentary critical infrastructures to meticulous space
science is driven by 21st century technology This age has seen the sudden rise of information
economy, refinements in machine learning followed by
an exponential growth in use of data driven, algorithm
driven and AI driven technology .This
progress has made data an indispensible
component of development for any
modern interprise. Privacy is one
of the biggest problems in this new
Electronic age. A force at the heart
of the Internet culture wants to know
everything about you and 200 million
others, and that info is a very valuable
asset tempting people to trade and
do commerce with. Consequently,
entities of all kinds :Commercial,
Governmental, Academic, etc. are
motivated to collect and analyze
as much data as possible for better
understanding of people.</p>
									<p>Whether innocuous or not, all these data accumulation
practices are becoming more invisible as we are lulled
into giving up our digital privacy to engage ourselves as
consumers in a connected world.</p>
									<p>Each time we browse, shop, share, read, like or follow,
make a reservation, pay, go online, we submit trackable
identifiers that are collected and sold to agencies, app
developers, marketers, and many others who profit from
knowledge of our behaviour. Whether we are tracked
as customers, constituents or research subjects, more of
our consumption preferences, geographic movements,
biometric informations, and even our DNA is being
recorded and interpreted. A common example is when
we search anything or the people we are connected to
show up as a part of our recommendations on other
sites. The big umbrella of Internet knows a lot more
about us than we realize.</p>
									<p><b>SUPREME COURT AND PRIVACY</b></p>
									<p>The Supreme Court of India, in a recent judgement
reiterated that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental
right of every citizen and even took suo moto cognizance
regarding the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of
Right to Life and personal liberty under Article 21 and
as part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the
Constitution. The case was referred to the bench in
relation to Aadhar and the legality of using biometrics
and private data of the people by the government (to
ensure national security is not breached).</p>
									<p>But private data is being widely tracked by the
government and other agencies (commercial entities, miscreants, hackers, financial fraudsters, etc) for other
purposes also. Images, videos and satellite tracking
systems are ubiquitous. Facial recognition, fingerprint
sensors and biometrics are becoming cheaper and more
accurate and are being deployed by commercial agents.
But it is more of an obstacle than a help for the national
security. One such example is the weak Cyber Security
of India which results in the flow of army intelligence
data as never seen in other countries. Other incidents
include the PANAMA PAPER LEAK[3/4/2016]
containing data of 11.5 million leaked documents
of thousands of officials; The 2019 FB data leak of
533 million users; Cambridge Analytica data Scandal
2016; The recent 7 may 2021 COLONIAL PIPELINE
ransomware cyberattack in USA; The use of Dark Web
for increasing terrorist and illegal marketing activities
and several other malware and cyber attacks makes us
think DO we really enjoy veracious privacy?</p>
									<p>From 2004-2009,the internet scams rose from
100,000/year to nearly 300,000/year [Internet Scam
Statistics]. From 2010-2012,it continued to rise beyond
350,000/ year, with a monetary loss of over $300 million
per year!</p>
									<p><b>PRIVACY CONCERNS</b></p>
									<p>Since Edward Snowden leaked various classified info
and disclosed the level and depth of global surveillance
during 2013 by various US and other government
agencies across nations, the right to privacy has
indeed become a serious question. At the moment, the
balance of power on Internet is highly skewed towards
service providers with massive capital resources; while
individuals are left with an onerous choice- use the
Internet and surrender some measure of data privacy, or
otherwise stay marginalized from the society.</p>
									
									<p><b>METADATA</b></p>
									<p>Metadata is descriptive information that pinpoints
your communications and other activities and can be
automatically processed to infer secondary info about
an individual’s sexual orientation, political and religious
views, race, intelligence and personality painting a
profound picture of our lives. Microsoft reports 70% of
U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet
information about them. This has created a need to
control online privacy settings in addition to controlling
our online reputations. Although government claims
metadata for its security purpose, but the data can be
potentially hacked, leaked or even sold in the black
market.</p>
									
									<p><b>GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE</b></p>
									<p>Mass surveillance of entire population across
national borders started in the mid 20th century when
the UKUSA agreement was enacted by the UK and USA,
later expanded to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
other ‘third-party’ nations to create the present ‘Five
Eyes’ alliance resulting in the establishment of a global
surveillance network, code named “ECHELON”.</p>
									<p>PURPOSES:- The April 2013 summary of leaked
documents by Snowden showed that other than to
combat terrorism, these programs were employed
to assess the foreign policy and economic stability of
other countries, and to gather “commercial secrets”. In
a December 2013 letter to the Brazilian government,
Snowden wrote that “these programs were never about
terrorism, they are about economic spying, social
control, and diplomatic manipulation. They are about
power.</p>
									
									<p><b>POLITICAL ESPIONAGE</b></p>
									<p>The April 2013 summary disclosed NSA’s
“intelligence priorities” on a scale of highest interest to
lowest interest which classified about 30 countries as
“3rd parties”, with whom it cooperates but also spies
on, of which the main targets were China, Russia, Iran,
Pakistan, and Afganistan. Other prominent targets were
members and adherents of Internet groups and potential
whistleblowers. Snowden said the NSA targeted
reporters who wrote critically about the US government
after 9/11.</p>
									<p>As a part of joint operation with the Central Intelligence
Agency the NSA deployed secret eavesdropping posts in
8 US Embassies and consultants worldwide. The 2013
data leak also revealed that many intergovernmental
organizations, diplomatic missions, and government
ministries including Embassy of India in Washington
DC and Permanent representative of India to the UN
have been subjected to surveillance by the “FIVE EYES”.
They collect metadata, infiltrate VPNs, copy entire hard
drive disks, hack e-mail, install covert listening devices,
and use many other methods to SPY on the agencies and
know everything about any country, providing them
with tremendous amount of power over us.</p>
									<p><b>SURVEILLANCE EVASION</b></p>
									<p>Several Nations have eluded global surveillance by
constructing secret bunker facilities deep below the
earth’s surface. Despite North Korea being a priority
target, NSA’s documents acknowledged it did not
know much about Kim Jong-un’s regime. Libya evaded surveillance by building buried bunkers 40 feet below
ground level. Iran’s police chief Esmail Ahmadi in Oct
2012 alleged Google to be a spying tool for Western
intelligence agencies; six months later; in April 2013,
the country announced plans to introduce an “Islamic
GOOGLE Earth” to avoid global surveillance.</p>
									<p></p>
									
									<p></p>
									<p><b>HOW TO CONTROL YOUR PRIVACY?</b></p>
									<p>Although controlling our data is technically
challenging or either we don’t bother, but if we want
to ensure our privacy we can take some steps to protect
and avoid our data contravansion to a large extent.
These include using a high-quality(paid) VPN service,
turning off WebRTC in browser, logons with difficult
passwords, antivirus protection, a firewall, using ad
blockers, installing Privacy Badger, and using something
called NoScript. In addition we can encrypt our e-mails
via S/MIME or PGP. Anonymizing proxies or networks
like I2P and Tor can be used to prevent Internet service
providers from knowing which sites we visit and with
whom we communicate. Signal app is notable for being
available on many devices and implementing a form of
perfect forward secrecy.
So, keeping yourself private from others may be
challenging but not impossible.</p>
									
									<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>
									<p>An archaic saying goes by, ‘Democracy and privacy
are myth’. If you participate in society to any degreeprivacy
is an illusion. Governments will need to go
after terrorist organizations to ensure national security.
Miscreants, hackers and financial and data scientists
will continue to mine high levels of private data.
Though most countries give citizens right to privacy in
their constitutions and there are international privacy
agreements, they are not as plausible as they seem. In
effect, securing right to privacy of individuals sounds
like a myth. At best, what can be done is to secure
individuals’ data by taking privacy measures at one’s
own level.</p>
